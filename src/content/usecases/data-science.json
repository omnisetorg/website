  "longDescription": "Linux is the dominant platform in data science and machine learning. Most ML frameworks are developed on Linux first, cloud computing runs on Linux, and the command-line tools essential for data pipelines work best on Linux. With native support for Python, R, Julia, and seamless Docker integration, Linux provides the ideal environment for data science work.",
  "benefits": [
    "Native Python environment with pip/conda",
    "TensorFlow and PyTorch run best on Linux",
    "Docker for reproducible environments",
    "SSH access to remote servers and clusters",
    "Jupyter notebooks work flawlessly",
    "Better GPU support for ML training",
    "Same environment as cloud/production"
